        <h2>Senior National Account Coordinator + Front End Developer</h2>

        <p>

          offices and partners to schedule and complete projects with our many
          global clients. As a Front End Developer, I have created projects to show design and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also one of two lead designers on a clothing brand that will be
          coming to the marketing in 2023.

          <h3>The Weather App</h3>

          <p class="project-summary">
            This weather app is fully functional. You can get the weather at
            your current location or search anywhere in the world! <br />
            <br />
            I created the outline for this app using a wireframe. From there,
            I designed this app myself and with the assistance of google and
            my wonderful instructor
            <a href="https://www.delac.io/">Matt Delac</a> with
            <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/">SheCodes</a>, I was able to
            make it work. My journey continues!
